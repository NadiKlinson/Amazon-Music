ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ ***Amazon Music (previously Amazon MP3) is a music streaming platform and digital music store operated by Amazon***

+  It was the first music store to sell music without digital rights management (DRM) from the four major music labels (EMI, Universal, Warner, and Sony BMG), as well as many independents. All tracks were originally sold in 256 kilobits-per-second variable bitrate MP3 format without per-customer watermarking or DRM; however, some tracks are now watermarked
